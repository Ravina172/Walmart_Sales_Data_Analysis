## Overview
This project simulates how a large retailer like Walmart can harness sales data to improve product performance, branch-level efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
By analyzing transactional data across branches, categories, and time periods, I surfaced patterns and insights that could drive smarter decisions around inventory, staffing, and strategic planning.

- Analyze payment methods by volume and customer preference
- Determine the busiest days/times per branch for staffing optimization
- Spot branches with declining revenue for early intervention
